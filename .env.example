# Worker Concurrency Settings
# CPU/GPU Intensive Workers: For workers running TensorFlow models or other ML tasks, keeping
# concurrency closer to your CPU core count prevents resource contention. These tasks benefit less
# from high concurrency because they're actively using computational resources, not waiting on IO.

# Mixed Workers: For tasks with both significant CPU and IO components, a moderate increase in
# concurrency (8-15) can help balance resource usage effectively.

# IO Intensive Workers: For workers that mostly read files, call APIs, or update databases,
# much higher concurrency settings (20-50) can significantly improve throughput as these
# operations spend most of their time waiting.
