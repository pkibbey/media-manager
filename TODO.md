-- I shouldn't store mixed types in the processing states, I should just track exif data and thumbnails in separate tables

-- Improve the performance of the database queries

-- Process each image for keyword analysis
-- Process each image for sentiment analysis
-- Process each image for perceived quality
-- Process each image for content safety

-- A way to recognize important events, and to give them a magnitude of importance, so that when scanning through a timeline of photos, it can sort by importance to select which image to show for a certain segment

-- process failed exif and failed thumbnails - examine the reasons in groups

-- Fix inconsistent error object structure
