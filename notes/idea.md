I have 200,000 files, both images and videos.

I've imported them into this Media Manager and have scanned every file for potential EXIF data.

I have a number of further processing steps to do on these files such as generating thumbnails, and performing AI analysis. However, I don't want to process all the files if I can help it.

I've created a section which can scan for duplicate images.
