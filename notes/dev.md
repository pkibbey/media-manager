Remember to split the advanced analysis into standard and advanced processing

Replace some of the more expensive tasks with cheaper tasks that run, and then based on something that they discover, add another task to the queue with something more expensive
- We could let the cheaper ones fail, and then we have a button to retry with a different task level

We probably don't need to show so many performance stats
