# Development Roadmap

- Implement importance scoring for timeline photo selection
  - This could be derived from the values stored about the media item

-- Facial recognition should be enhanced for learning, by allowing unknown faces to be marked as known.

-- Store thresholds in state and reduce after a successful pass through the files

-- The exif reader can validate mime types, but I think we have a robust solution

-- We might be able to get rid of the media type category, since this could always be inferred by splitting the mime-type. This should only ever be used for display purposes anyway.
