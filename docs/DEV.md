# Development Roadmap

- Implement importance scoring for timeline photo selection
  - This could be derived from the values stored about the media item

-- Facial recognition should be enhanced for learning, by allowing unknown faces to be marked as known.

-- Store thresholds in state and reduce after a successful pass through the files

-- Add more camera raw formats to isCameraRawFile as needed

-- Move the file-type checking to the file-type step, to help speed up initial import

-- handle adding and removing files from the source directory - scan for changes

-- remember to add dcraw instructions

-- consider when a good time to optimize is

-- you could always optimize the code too, to balance tech debt

-- find failed files and figure out how to process them
