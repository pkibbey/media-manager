# Development Roadmap

- Implement importance scoring for timeline photo selection
  - This could be derived from the values stored about the media item

-- Facial recognition should be enhanced for learning, by allowing unknown faces to be marked as known.

-- store thresholds in state and reduce after a successful pass through the files

-- We might not even need the file type step. This could be done by the exif reader stage.
